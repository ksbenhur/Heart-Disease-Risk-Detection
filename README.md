# Heart-Disease-Risk-Detection
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early  detection is crucial for effective treatment and management. By applying supervised learning  techniques to the UCI Heart Disease dataset, we can develop predictive models that help identify  individuals at risk of heart disease. 

Such models not only contribute to advancing medical
 research but also have the potential to aid healthcare professionals in making more informed
 decisions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and saving lives. Given its prominence in the
 research community, it provides a robust framework for developing and testing predictive
 models aimed at classifying the presence or absence of heart disease based on various patient
 attributes
